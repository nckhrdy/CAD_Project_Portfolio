# USyd Group 5 SonoBuoy Project

# Summary

Worked in team of 5 students to design and prototype a small scale sonobuoy that had to drop from a predetermined height, float on the water for a set range of seconds and then slowly sink and sit at the bottom of a water tank. 

This is our final report that includes our design considerations, stress analysis, and our part and assembly drawings. 

The drawings are in the final section of the report.
